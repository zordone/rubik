# Rubik

A fun Rubik's cube simulation I made years ago (~2014).

### Features 

It can shuffle and solve the cube automatically, and you can try it manually too. 

You can rotate the cube by dragging.

### Tech

ES5 + some ES6, jQuery, plain CSS.

The whole cube is made from `div`s, with various 3D transforms applied to them.

### Usage

Just open `rubik.html` from the filesystem. Preferably in Chrome.

Or you can just try it out [here](https://zordone.github.io/rubik/rubik.html) without downloading.

### Notes

1. The editing feature is a bit buggy, but I couldn't be bothered to debug it.

2. The code is quite messy. I've cleaned it up a bit and sprinkled a little ES6 on it, but still.
